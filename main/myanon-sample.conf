# List of tables/fields to anonymize.
# tables and fields are back-quoted.
#
# for each field, choose one of the following:
# inthash N:
#   creates a hash for integer value, N digits long, up to 32 digits.
# texthash N:
#   creates a hash for text value, N chars long, up to 32 chars.
# fixed 'myvalue':
#   creates a field with value myvalue. The result may be quoted of not,
#   depending on the field type. For example:
#     fixed '5' inserts '5' as value for text fields
#     fixed '5' inserts 5 as value for int fields
#   However, if needed, quoting can be manually controlled by adding
#   'quoted' or 'unquoted' keyword before value.
#   This may be usefull for blob fields:
#     fixed unquoted '0x1234'
# fixed null:
#   inserts NULL as value
# emailhash 'domain.com' N:
#   creates a hash for email, ending with 'domain.com',
#   N chars long (including domain), up to 32 chars
